                        <p>A patent has been published on this project on the Indian IPO Website.The AI and IoT-based Smart Waste Management System utilizes sensors, machine learning,
                            and automated mechanisms to optimize waste collection in malls and corporations. 
                            It features a smart bin equipped with load cells, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors to monitor and classify waste, sending real-time 
                            data and alerts to maintenance teams only when necessary. This system reduces operational costs, enhances waste management efficiency, 
                            and supports sustainability efforts by minimizing waste collection frequency and fuel consumption.</p>

                        <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are being integrated into Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) 
                            to enhance network security by addressing the limitations of traditional rule-based methods. 
                            Unlike conventional systems, GAN-based IDS (GAN-IDS) continuously learn from historical data and adapt to emerging
                            threats, improving detection precision and reducing false positives. 
                            This approach also enhances the system's ability to recognize zero-day attacks, offering a more robust
                            defense against novel cyber threats in a constantly evolving digital environment.</p>

                        <p>This paper has been published in IJIRT Journal. Underwater imaging faces challenges like light scattering, color distortion, and low illumination, 
                            degrading image quality and limiting their use in fields such as marine biology and archaeology. 
                            This paper presents histogram-based techniques for enhancing underwater images, focusing on adaptive histogram equalization (AHE)
                            and linear histogram manipulation to improve contrast, visibility, and detail extraction. 
                            These methods adjust pixel intensities to reveal hidden information, making them effective for processing 
                            large datasets and overcoming underwater imaging limitations.</p>

                        <p>This paper is currently under review to be published in ETSAR Journal. 
                            This paper presents an automated system for skin type classification, incorporating both skin tone and common skin diseases to provide personalized product recommendations. 
                            The model uses machine learning algorithms, such as Inception and Individual Topology Angle (ITA) computation, to analyze images for skin tone detection and disease identification. 
                            By integrating these analyses into a single interface, the system offers quick, user-friendly skincare advice tailored to individual needs, enhancing the accessibility and personalization of skincare product selection.</p>

                        <p>The analysis of the Haberman's Survival Dataset indicates that the number of positive axillary nodes is a crucial predictor of breast cancer survival, 
                            with fewer nodes linked to longer survival. Patients who survived more 
                            than 5 years had an average of 2.98 nodes, while those who died within 5 years had 7.5 nodes on average. 
                            Age had a minimal impact on survival. The dataset, consisting of 289 observations, 
                            revealed that axillary node count is a key factor in predicting patient outcomes post-surgery.</p>

                        <p>Face recognition systems, though less accurate than iris or fingerprint methods, are valued for their non-invasive nature and ease of use. This system aims to streamline attendance marking by 
                            using face recognition to replace manual roll calls and reduce proxy attendance. 
                            It operates in four phases: creating a database, detecting faces with Haar-Cascade, recognizing faces using Local Binary Pattern Histogram, and updating attendance. 
                            By automating attendance through live video streaming, this method offers a quicker and more efficient solution compared to traditional methods</p>

                            Recent advancements in Information and Communication Technologies have enabled the development of virtual keyboards, 
                            which are especially useful for compact devices where traditional hardware keyboards are impractical. This project focuses on
                            creating a virtual keyboard for the English language using image processing techniques. The virtual keyboard can be displayed on 
                            screens or projected onto surfaces, offering flexibility and reducing environmental impact compared to physical keyboards. 
                            Users can easily customize and replace the virtual keyboard as needed, making it a versatile and eco-friendly solution.</p>

                        <h3>Performance Analysis for Hybrid Beamforming using Deep Learning</h3>
                        <p>Hybrid beamforming combines analog and digital techniques to optimize MIMO systems, but traditionally relies on complex channel state 
                            information (CSI). This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning model that uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements 
                            instead of CSI, simplifying design and reducing costs. The approach improves spectral efficiency in FDD systems and avoids detailed CSI feedback. 
                            A deep neural network (DNN) is used for optimizing both beamforming components, leveraging a custom dataset for enhanced efficiency and robustness.</p>

                        <h3>Crime Analysis using Clustering</h3>
                        <p>This research paper performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on U.S. crime data to uncover trends and patterns. By cleaning and preprocessing the data, 
                            and using clustering analysis, we identify crime patterns and relationships with factors like population density and socioeconomic status. The findings 
                            provide insights into crime trends and help guide effective strategies for law enforcement and policymakers. 
                            This study demonstrates the value of EDA in understanding and addressing crime.</p>

                        <h3>Thermometer Using PIC18F4520 Microcontroller</h3>
                        <p>Developed a thermometer using the PIC18F4520 microcontroller and coded it in C using MPLAB. The LM35 Temperature Sensor measures the temperature, which is then 
                            converted from analog to digital by multiplying by a step size of 4.88. 
                            The binary data is further converted to ASCII and displayed on an LCD screen as a string. 
                            This project effectively measures and displays temperature for various applications.</p>

                        <h3>Classification using Reinforcement Learning and Q Learning</h3>
                        <p>Reinforcement learning focuses on learning optimal actions through interactions with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Q-learning, a popular algorithm in this
                            field, utilizes a table to track expected rewards for state-action pairs and updates it using the Bellman equation. We aim to apply Q-learning to classify roads as clean or 
                            dirty using a dataset of 237 images, with the goal of improving road maintenance, preventing disease spread, and enhancing community aesthetics. This classification can guide timely cleaning
                            efforts and contribute to a healthier and more appealing environment.</p>
